# **The Walking Dead**
*Based on the comic book series written by Robert Kirkman, this gritty drama portrays life in the months and years that follow a "zombie apocalypse". A group of survivors travel in search of safety and security, constantly on the move in search of a secure home. But the pressure each day to stay alive sends many in the group to the deepest depths of human cruelty, and they soon discover that the overwhelming fear of the survivors can be more deadly than the zombies walking among them. At times, the interpersonal conflicts present a greater threat to their continuing survival than the walkers that roam the country*
